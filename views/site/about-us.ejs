We operate over 40 auctions rooms nationwide, holding in excess of 200 auctions and selling over 3,000 properties every single year. We believe in selling at a local, regional and national level, and that local properties sell better to local buyers, which is why we operate auction rooms across England, Wales and Scotland. Each of the Auction House members are well respected and experts in their region. This means they can personally carry out valuations on your property, with a full knowledge of the surrounding area.</p>
